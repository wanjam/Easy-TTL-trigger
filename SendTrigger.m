function SendTrigger(triggervalue, triggerduration, Port)
% SENDTRIGGER(triggervalue,triggerduration,Port) sends a trigger to a parallel port
%
% triggervalue: numerical value of trigger code to be sent (1-255).
% triggerduration: duration of the trigger signal in seconds (eg. 0.020).
% (optional) Port = hexadecimal version of port address (look it up in
% windows' device manager) | on Linux it's usually a single number (1 for
% the first port, 2 for the 2nd etc)
